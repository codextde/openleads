# OpenLeads - Lead Scraper Open Source Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Lead Scraper Open Source Project! This project aims to develop a robust lead scraping tool that integrates a Chrome Extension with a server-side crawler to find and aggregate lead data from websites. By leveraging the power of OpenAI's API, our tool will summarize and present the data in a user-friendly dashboard, similar to platforms like [Ocean.io](https://ocean.io), [Apollo.io](https://apollo.io), and [StoreLeads](https://storeleads.com).

## Features

- **Chrome Extension**: Easily scrape lead data while browsing websites.
- **Server-Side Crawler**: Efficiently crawl websites to gather comprehensive lead data.
- **OpenAI API Integration**: Utilize OpenAI to process and summarize lead data.
- **Dashboard**: View and manage your leads in an intuitive dashboard built with NuxtJs.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: NuxtJs
- **Browser Extension**: Chrome Extension
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express (or similar framework)
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI API

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed
- Google Chrome browser
- OpenAI API key

## Installation

### Install dependencies for the server and frontend

```bash
npm install
```

### Set up the Chrome Extension
